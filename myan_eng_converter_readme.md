[Burmese Phonology
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_phonology)

[Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar), or [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar), is a member of the [Lolo-Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolo-Burmese_languages) branch of the [Sino-Tibetan language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages) family. It is spoken mainly in [Myanmar ([Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamar_people))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar), where it is the official language. In 2007 there were about 33 million people who spoke [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language) as a first language. There are also thought to be another 10 million who speak it as a second language.

[Standard Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language) is spoken in the Irrawaddy River valley. Within that area there are minor differences in vocabulary and pronunciation between the [Mandalay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay) dialect of [Upper Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Myanmar) and the [Yangon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon) dialect of [Lower Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Myanmar). Burmese dialects in other parts of Burma differ more from the standard, but they are all more or less mutually intelligible.

There are two registers of Burmese: high and low. The high register is used in formal literature, newspapers, radio and formal speeches. The low register is used in television, comics, informal literature, and everyday conversation. Since the 1960s some Burmese writers have promoted the use of the low register, and have suggest the abandoning of the high register.

The name Myanmar (မြန်မာ [mjəmà]) is the high register name for the country, and Burma (ဗမာ [bəmà]) is the low register name. Both names derive from the [Bamar people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamar_people) (ဗမာလူမျိုး [bəmà lùmjó]), the largest ethnic group in Burma. The full official name of the country is the "Republic of the Union of Myanmar" (ပြည်ထောင်စုသမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော် [pjìdàʊɴzṵ θàɴməda̰ mjəmà nàɪɴŋàɴdɔ̀]).

# Written Burmese
The Burmese or Myanmar script developed from the [Mon script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon%E2%80%93Burmese_script), which was adapted from a [southern Indian script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script) during the 8th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century.

# Notable Features
Type of writing system: [Abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida) / Syllabic Alphabet - each letter has an inherent [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel), which is pronounced [a̰] or [ə] [a]. Other [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel) sounds are indicated using separate letters or diacritics which appear above, below, in front of, after or around the consonant.

## Burmese alphabet
The [Burmese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet) ([Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language): မြန်မာအက္ခရာ mranma akkha.ra, pronounced [[mjəmà ʔɛʔkʰəjà](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Burmese)]) is an [abugida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida) used for writing [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet). It is ultimately adapted from a [Brahmic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts), either the [Kadamba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadamba_script) or [Pallava alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script) of [South India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India). The [Burmese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet) is also used for the liturgical languages of [Pali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script) and [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit). In recent decades, other, related alphabets, such as [Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language#Alphabet) and modern [Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_alphabet), have been restructured according to the standard of the [Burmese alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet).

Burmese is written from left to right and requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability and to avoid grammar ambiguity. There are several systems of transliteration into the Latin alphabet; for this article, the [MLC Transcription System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC_Transcription_System) is used.

# Writing direction: left to right in horizontal lines.
Script family: Proto-Sinaitic, Phoenician, Aramaic, [Brāhmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts), Tamil-Brahmi, [Pallava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_script), [Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet)
Used to write: [Burmese/Myanmar (ဗမာစကား)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language), Karen and Mon.
The rounded appearance of letters is a result of the use of palm leaves as the traditional writing material. Straight lines would have torn the leaves. The Burmese name for the script is ca-lonh 'round script'.
[Burmese is a tonal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language) with three main tones (high, low and creaky) and two other tones (stopped and reduced). The tones are indicated in writing using diacritics or special letters.
